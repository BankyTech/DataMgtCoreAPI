# API Best Practices for .NET Core

## Dependency Injection

It is generally not recommended to use multiple dependency injection (DI) frameworks in the same .NET Core API application.

Microsoft's built-in DI framework is a lightweight and easy-to-use DI container that is sufficient for most .NET Core API applications. It provides basic functionality for registering and resolving dependencies and is optimized for performance.

Autofac is another popular DI framework for .NET Core that provides more advanced features, such as assembly scanning and more flexible lifetime management options. It is a powerful tool that can be useful for more complex applications with advanced DI needs.

However, using multiple DI frameworks in the same application can lead to confusion and unnecessary complexity. It can also result in conflicts between the frameworks and make it harder to manage the application's dependencies.

**Best Practice**: Choose one framework that meets your needs and stick with it. If you find that the built-in DI framework is not sufficient for your needs, you can consider using a more advanced framework like Autofac. However, it is important to carefully consider your application's requirements and choose the right tool for the job.

## Package Management

It is generally not recommended to use NuGet packages that were built for the .NET Framework 4.6.x version in a .NET Core API application.

.NET Core and .NET Framework are two different frameworks with different runtime environments and API sets. While .NET Core is a cross-platform and open-source framework, .NET Framework is a Windows-only framework that is no longer actively developed. While some .NET Framework packages may be compatible with .NET Core, it is generally best to use packages that are specifically built for .NET Core.

Using .NET Framework packages in a .NET Core API application can result in compatibility issues and may cause unexpected runtime errors. In addition, .NET Framework packages may contain dependencies that are not compatible with .NET Core, which can further complicate the integration process.

**Best Practice**: Use NuGet packages that are specifically built for .NET Core to ensure the best compatibility and performance. If you need to use a specific package that is only available for .NET Framework, consider using a compatibility layer, such as .NET Standard or .NET Core's Compatibility Shim, but be aware this approach can be complex and may require significant effort.

## Entity Project Naming

**Question**: What should be the name of the project if I am creating a separate project for keeping entity classes?

The name of the project where you keep your entity classes depends on your project structure and naming conventions. However, it is common to name this project as "Domain" or "Core" or "Entities" to indicate that it contains the core domain entities of the application.

**Examples**:
- For a general application: `MyApplication.Domain` or `MyApplication.Entities`
- For domain-specific applications: `MyApplication.ECommerce` or `MyApplication.Shop`

**Best Practice**: The name should be descriptive and follow your team's conventions. Choose based on your project's requirements and the conventions used by your development team.

## Additional Best Practices

### Error Handling
- Always implement proper error handling with meaningful error messages
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500)
- Log errors for debugging and monitoring purposes

### Input Validation
- Validate all input parameters
- Check for null values and invalid data
- Return clear validation error messages

### Security
- Keep NuGet packages updated to avoid security vulnerabilities
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

### Code Organization
- Follow SOLID principles
- Use dependency injection for loose coupling
- Implement repository pattern for data access
- Separate concerns into appropriate layers

### Performance
- Use async/await patterns for I/O operations
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Monitor and optimize database queries
- Use appropriate data types and collections

### Testing
- Write unit tests for business logic
- Implement integration tests for API endpoints
- Use proper mocking for external dependencies
- Maintain good test coverage
